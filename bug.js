```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <div class="flex justify-between">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">My Component</h2>
    <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
      Click Me
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. However, the button might not be visually well-integrated with the overall layout.  The button might appear too small or the spacing is off, leading to a cluttered look.  Another issue might be that the button style clashes with the parent container's background.
